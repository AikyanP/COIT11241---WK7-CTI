# COIT11241---WK7-CTI

This task involves numerous steps to setup and use tools provided to search the information system using vulnerabilities.

Firstly, prerequisite apps outlined by the task were first installed into the DC VM. The installation is confirmed by double checking its install location which is present and contains files.
Secondly, setting up a shared folder for Wazuh was recommended for transferring files from host to VM or vice versa.
Following this, tools outside Wazuh such as Nessus, Nikto, Legion, Nmap and Wafw00f were used to scan for vulnerabilities within the DC VM.
This is then followed by using Wazuh itself to search for vulnerabilties.
The indentified vulnerabilities are then prioritised and discusses the important ATT&CK TTPs, CAPECs and CWEs for the Monto Caravan and Cabin Park Information System.
